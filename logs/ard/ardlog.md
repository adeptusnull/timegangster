## ARD-001
**Date**: 2025-04-05  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Claude

### Context
#### Problem Statement
Project needed proper npm scripts configuration and version synchronization to ensure the package can be properly built, tested, and published.

#### Constraints
- Must maintain ESM compatibility
- Must adhere to existing project structure
- Ensure version consistency across package.json and code

2. Synchronized version numbers:
   - Updated server version in code to match package.json (1.0.4)
   - Added main entry point in package.json

3. Established project documentation:
   - Created ARD log to track architectural decisions

### Technical Impact
- Improved build process automation
- Simplified CLI execution
- Ensured proper package publishing workflow
- Added documentation for architectural decisions

### Implementation Plan
- Verify build process with `npm run build`
- Test CLI functionality
- Monitor for any version inconsistencies
